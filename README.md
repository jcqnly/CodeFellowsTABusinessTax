Your Account ID is your Business License # without the 001-001 after it. 
6. Don't know your Account or Letter ID? Both are on the physical copy of the Combined Excise Tax Return that was mailed:

7. Your DOR Home should now look like this:
![New Home Page](/assets/newHome.png)
Click "Excise Tax" to start the filing process.
8. At the top right is a box that starts with "I Want To".  Click "File or Amend Tax Return"
![Start File Tax](/assets/StartFileTax.png)
9. The next page should look similar to this:![Select the Right Tax](/assets/SelectTaxes.png)  If all you did was TA with this license, then you have provided a service and this is the only box to select. Select Next at the bottom.
10. **It is highly unlikely that you made more than $57,000/year as a CF TA, which means your business qualifies for a credit and you will pay no taxes.  This is a WA state tax credit for small business**  The next page should look similar to this: ![Tax Credi](/assets/taxCredit.png)
11. _**I don't know for certain the rest of these steps because I paper filed for 2018.  Contributions are appreciated beyond this point!**_ If you click Next, I think they'll ask you for your bank info for payment, but you won't pay anything due to the WA state tax credit.
12. Please note that those who did e-File said that nothing zero-ed out on that last picture you see, so it'll have that tax total still.
